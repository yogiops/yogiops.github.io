Hey everyone! I'm Yogev Tehen, 24 years old, and I've been fascinated by the world of cybersecurity for as long as I can remember. Currently, I work as an Information Security Engineer at PayMe, and in my spare time, I dive deep into researching vulnerabilities on various websites.

The goal of this blog is to share my knowledge with all of you, so get ready for some insightful and hopefully fun content!

Feel free to reach out to me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yogev-tehen-ba5898220?utm_source=share&utm_campaign=share_via&utm_content=profile&utm_medium=ios_app" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> for any inquiries or just to say hello.
